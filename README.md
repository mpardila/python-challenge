PyBank:

Folder with Resources - budget_data.csv file
Folder with Analysis - Text file of the code run in terminal and print screen of the result

I used Xpert Learning Assistance for the average profit and losses average and to get the round to 2 decimal function.

PyPoll:

Folder with Resources - election_data.csv file
Folder with Analysis - Text file of the code run in terminal and print screen of the result

I used Xpert Learning Assistance to consolidate adding candidates to the dictionary and the running total of votes per candidate in only one if statement and to get the round to 2 decimal function.

During office hours, Matt helped me understand how to get to the key-value pair through print and find a way to identify the most votes in that same for loop.
